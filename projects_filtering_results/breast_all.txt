The conical tubes containing tissue, ceramic beads and buffer were then shaken in a MP Biomedicals FastPrep machine until the tissue was visibly homogenized (90 seconds at 6.5 meters per second). The homogenized tissue was stored at -80\u00c2\u00b0C. Total RNA was extracted from 5 million cultured cells or 350 uL of tissue homogenate (equivalent to 10 mg of tissue) using the Norgen Animal Tissue RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek Corporation). Cell lysate was treated with Proteinase K before it was applied to the column and on-column DNase treatment was performed according to the manufacturer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instructions. Total RNA was eluted from the columns and quantified using the Qubit RNA Assay Kit and the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). RNA-seq libraries for each sample were constructed from 250 ng total RNA using the polyA selection and transposase-based non-stranded library construction (Tn-RNA-seq) described previously (Gertz et al. Transposase mediated construction of RNA-seq libraries.2012. Genome Res 22 (1):134-141). RNA-seq libraries were barcoded during PCR using Nextera barcoded primers according to the manufacturer (Epicentre). The RNA-seq libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen) and three barcoded libraries were pooled in equimolar quantities for sequencing. The pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing machine using paired-end 50 bp reads and a 6 bp index read, and we obtained at least 50 million read pairs from each library.",

When ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and/or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) were present, these were also cored. Three to ten tissue cores were pooled for each diagnosis per patient, and tissue cores were re-embedded in paraffin and re-evaluated histologically for lesion purity by sectioning length-wise along the core. Only samples which possessed >90% of luminal cells with the appropriate diagnosis within the epithelial compartment were included among our samples. Adjacent normal cores contained no identifiable pathologies, and cancer cores possessed less than 5% early neoplasia or normal epithelial cells. In all cases stromal cells were present in the core samples. DNA and total RNA were purified from paraffin slices of the embedded tissue cores following deparaffination with a xylene incubation, ethanol wash, and a protease digestion, using the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Ambion/Life Technologies catalog #1975). 3SEQ libraries were prepared from as little as 5 ug total RNA. RNA was enriched for 3\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ends by using the Oligotex mRNA mini Kit (QIAgen). The 3\u00e2\u0080\u0099- poly(A)-enriched RNA pools were made into directional 3SEQ Illumina sequencing libraries as follows. RNA that was not sufficiently fragmented was heat-sheared to a size of approximately 100-200 bases by incubation with First Strand Buffer (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) and oligo-dT-P7 primer (5\u00e2\u0080\u0099- CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GCT CTT CCG ATC TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TVN -3\u00e2\u0080\u0099) at 85oC for 3-5 minutes, depending on the extent of fragmentation required. The mixture was cooled to 50oC and first strand cDNA synthesis was performed in a 20 ul reaction using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) for 1 hour at 50oC. Second strand cDNA was synthesized using Second Strand Buffer (Invitrogen/Life Technologies), DNA ligase (Invitrogen/Life Technologies), DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs), and RNaseH (Epicentre Biotechnologies/Illumina), and purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAgen). 3\u00e2\u0080\u0099 end repair and modification used dATP, Klenow exo (New England Biolabs) and Klenow Buffer, and was purified using the QIAgen MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAgen). cDNA was then ligated to the double-stranded P5 Linker (Adapter Oligo Mix Illumina) for 15 minutes at 22oC. SPRI bead purification (Agencourt Biosciences/Beckman Coulter) was performed both prior to and following PCR amplification of the linker-ligated cDNA using 5' - AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GAG ATC TAC ACT CTT TCC CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC T - 3' and 5' - CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GCT CTT CCG ATC - 3' primers and the Phusion PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs) using a 15 cycle program (98oC for 30 sec 15 cycles of 98oC for 10 sec, 65oC for 30 sec, 72oC for 30 sec 72oC for 5 min). The libraries were then size selected for 200\u00e2\u0080\u0093300 bp fragments by agarose gel fractionation (3% Nusieve GTG Lonza/Fisher Scientific) and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAgen).

Following pathological examination, tissue in excess of diagnostic requirements was collected and subsequently de-identified at the tissue bank. The tissue was then transported on ice to the laboratory. Samples that were collected in the evening were stored in media at 4C overnight. The duration from surgery to the commencement of tissue dissociation did not exceed 24 hrs, the majority of the samples were processed on the same day as surgery. Fragments of normal ER+ breast tissue were of insufficient cell number to utilize FACS after they were dissociated as described above, so epithelial cell enrichment was performed by utilizing magnetic EasySEP EpCAM beads (StemCell Technologies). Once the cells were washed in cold PBS, the appropriate amount of selection media and magnetic particles was added and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Next, the tube was placed on the magnet at room temperature for five minutes and eluted with chilled media and this process was repeated for a total of four times to enrich for the ER+/EpCAM+ epithelial tumor cells. Immuno-labelling of normal cells was performed at 4C using PBS as a buffer and wash solution. Incubating the cell pellet with 0.1 mg/ml DNase, 1 mg/ml rat immunoglobulin and a 1/10 dilution of anti-CD16/CD32 receptor antibody for 10 min. was sufficient to block non-specific antibody binding. The cell suspension was then made up to a final concentration of 106 cells /40 \u00ef\u0081\u00adl with dilution buffer. For primary human breast tissue, antibodies directed against human lineage markers CD31 (endothelial cells), CD45 (leukocytes) and CD235a (red blood cells) were used to prepare a Lin- cell population, and these PE-linked antibodies were negatively selected against. Primary antibodies were added at optimized dilutions and incubated for 25 min at 4C. The suspension was then washed, filtered using 40uM tube cap filters (Falcon) and centrifuged. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 \u00ef\u0081\u00adg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) before cell analysis and sorting to allow for only the selection of viable cells. Cell analysis and sorting was performed on either a FACS DIVA or FACS Aria (BD Biosciences) using a sheath pressure of 30 psi and nozzle size of 70 um. Cells were sorted into polystyrene FACS tubes (Westnet #352063) and collected into a mixture of 50% primary MEC media and 50% CDT. Reanalysis of the sorted populations routinely revealed a purity of more than 95%.",

For siRNA-mediated depletion of PRPF8, Cal51 cells were transfected with DharmaFECT1 (Dharmafect) with 25 nM siRNA against human PRPF8. Transfected cells were harvested 54 hrs later, exposed to UV-C light and used for iCLIP. For collection of samples from different stages of the cell cycle, Cal51 cells were synchronized in G1/S by standard double thymidine block. Briefly, cells were treated with 1.5 mM thymidine for 8 hrs, washed and released for 8 hrs, then treated again with thymidine for a further 8 hrs. Cells were also collected 3 hrs (S-phase) and 7 hrs (G2) after release from the thymidine block. The iCLIP protocol was followed to isolate RNA bound to the spliceosome and amplify a cDNA library as described in the manuscript. An anti-SmB antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. Specific barcodes were used for each RT reaction, with random nucleotides also incorporated into cDNAs to distinguish between PCR duplication of cDNA products.",

Melanoma RNA was obtained from patient cell lines, including 3 originating from metastasized stage IV melanoma (A-series) and 10 originating from resected lymph nodes from patients with stage 3 disease (C-series. RNA was extracted with RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Breast cancer cell lines were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), sodium pyruvate, 10\u00ef\u0081\u00adg/ml insulin and antibiotics. Normal breast epithelial cell line, Bre-80 (provided as a gift from Roger Reddel, CMRI, Sydney) was grown in DMEM/F12 medium with 5% horse serum (HS), 10\u00ef\u0081\u00adg/ml insulin, 0.5\u00ef\u0081\u00adg/ml hydrocortisone, 20ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100ng/ml cholera toxin and antibiotics. Cell lines were maintained under standard conditions routinely tested for Mycoplasma and short tandem repeat (STR) profiled for authentication. RNA was extracted with RNeasy columns (Qiagen). RNA was DNAse treated with TurboDNase (Life Technologies), confirmed DNA-free, RNA integrity was confirmed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). rRNA depletion (Ribo-Zero\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 (Epicentre)) was performed on 5\u00ce\u00bcg of total RNA. ERCC RNA Spike-In Control mix 1 or mix 2 (Life Technologies) were added to ribodepleted RNA to a final dilution of 1/100. Libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and 9-12 cycles of pre-capture LM-PCR performed as required. Multiplex library pools were created by mixing equal amounts of 5 pre-capture sample libraries and capture hybridization performed on 1 \u00ce\u00bcg of the pooled library. Melanoma A-series samples were each randomly assigned to one of three capture hybridizations to ensure any expression differences between the A and C-series samples were not due to an A-series batch effect. Post-capture LMPCR was performed for 17 cycles.",
